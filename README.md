##  Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve business performance.  
The dataset was stored in **Feather format** for efficient reading and writing.  
Using Python and visualization libraries, the project answers six key business questions related to monthly sales trends, city performance, and product popularity.

##  Business Questions Solved

### 1. How to read Feather data?
Demonstrated how to import `.feather` files using **pandas** and **pyarrow** for faster I/O operations.  
```python
import pandas as pd
all_data = pd.read_feather(r"C:\Users\sprav\Downloads\4..+Sales+Analysis/Sales_data.ftr")
```
<br>

### 2. Which is the best month for sales?

Calculated monthly revenue and identified the month with the highest total sales, helping to understand seasonal sales patterns.
