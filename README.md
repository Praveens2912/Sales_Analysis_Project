##  Project Overview
This project analyzes sales data to uncover meaningful insights that can help improve business performance.  
The dataset was stored in **Feather format** for efficient reading and writing.  
Using Python and visualization libraries, the project answers six key business questions related to monthly sales trends, city performance, and product popularity.

##  Business Questions Solved

### 1. How to read Feather data?
Demonstrated how to import `.feather` files using **pandas** and **pyarrow** for faster I/O operations.  
```python
import pandas as pd
all_data = pd.read_feather(r"C:\Users\sprav\Downloads\4..+Sales+Analysis/Sales_data.ftr")
```

### 2. Which is the best month for sales?

Calculated monthly revenue and identified the month with the highest total sales, helping to understand seasonal sales patterns.

### 3. Which city has the maximum number of orders?

Analyzed city-wise order counts to find which city generated the most sales.

### 4. What product sold the most and why?

Examined the top-selling products and explored possible reasons such as price range, promotions, and customer demand.

### 5. Understanding trend of the most sold products

Visualized sales trends of popular products using Matplotlib and Seaborn to identify growth and demand patterns.

### 6. What products are most often sold together?

Performed a combination analysis to find items frequently purchased together, useful for cross-selling strategies.
